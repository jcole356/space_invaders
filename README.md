## Description
Space Invaders is a remake of the classic arcade game.  The goal of the
game is to shoot all of the descending invaders before they either reach
the ground or destroy your cannon with their lasers.  If you shoot them
all... you win.  Otherwise you lose.  Pretty simple.

This version of Space Invaders was written in JavaScript using jQuery.
